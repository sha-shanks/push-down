# Google Homepage Popup Blocker

A lightweight Chrome extension that blocks the "Sign in to Google" or "Use Chrome for a better experience" pop-up on the [Google homepage](https://www.google.com/) and ensures your typing always stays focused in the search box.

## How It Works

    - Detects and hides the pop-up element (by its class name).
    - Keeps the search box (`input[name="q"]`) focused at all times.
